# Mealwise
A web app to help a restaurant keep track of its inventory throughout the day. Capstone project for [Codecademy Django](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-python-web-apps-with-django) course.

This app uses [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/), [htmx](https://htmx.org/), [_hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org/), [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) for the revenue chart, and [django-admin-interface](https://github.com/fabiocaccamo/django-admin-interface). The majority of that was added after completing the requirements for the assignment (v1.0)

## Try it Out

Visit [iamjameswalters.pythonanywhere.com](https://iamjameswalters.pythonanywhere.com/) to interact with a live demo of the app. The database should reset nightly. Feel free to create your own account, or use `user: testuser/pass: mealwise`. Without signing in, you can place and delete orders. All the other features require an account.

## Local Installation

Dependencies and virtual environments on this project are managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). After cloning the project, enter the repository and run `poetry install`. This will install all the project's dependencies within a virtual environment. Once that's done, run `poetry shell` to enter that environment, and navigate to the `mealwise/` directory to run `manage.py runserver`. Have fun! üôÇÔ∏è
