# codecademy-mealwise
A web app to help a restaurant keep track of its inventory throughout the day. Capstone project for Codecademy Django course.

## Installation

After cloning the project, enter the repository and run `poetry install`. This will install all the project's dependencies within a virtual environment. Once that's done, run `poetry shell` to enter that environment, and navigate to the `mealwise/` directory to run `manage.py runserver`. Have fun! 🙂️
